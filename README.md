Collaboration effort of Peter Chambers, Lauren Smith, Ben Palmer, and Carson Smith


We created a selfcheckout item recognition application that identifies and records the items that pass through the video feed, 
records it and compares it with the checkout reciept. And alerts if there is a discrepancy.

Our purpose was to create a solution to the rising tide of fraud and theft at supermarket selfcheckout stands.

# Future Work
We would like to increase the training set the modle to make it more robust and less error prone when it comes to recognizing objects.
